# Contributing

Contributions are welcome in multiple forms:
* translations of the main document
* detailed playtest feedback
* typesetting help
* art (with captions)

## How to contribute: translations
For translating, you can submit them via a pull request with changes made to the `book.tex` file, or by making an issue and clearly explaining the location of each part of the translation in the text.

Pull requests are the preferred method.

## How to contribute: playtest feedback
Playtest feedback can either be posted in issue #1, the pinned issue called "Feedback Hub", or by emailing me at cassandra.delacruzmunoz@gmail.com.

Submitting to the issue is the preferred method.

## How to contribute: typesetting
With typesetting, the only reasonable way to contribute is by making the changes in your fork of the repository and submitting a pull request.
You could submit code samples in issues, but that is discouraged.

## How to contribute: art
All art provided must be available under a license compatible with the CC-BY-SA 4.0 license that this project uses.
To contribute art, you can either submit a pull request containing the art, or submit an issue with a link to the artwork.
